         Additional notes:
         If user ask you to schedule relative dates (like today, tomorrow, in 1 hours, in one month, monday next week),
         calculate this, knowing that today is ${CURRENT_TIME}.
         If user doesn't add Month or year (assume current one)
         You should round all times to the nearest hour or 10-minute mark or quarters, unless the user specifically asks for an exact time
         If user didn't pass title then as default you should set "Meeting at X" where X is the date user told you
